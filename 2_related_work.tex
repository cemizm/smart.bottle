Amft, O. et al. \cite{5470653} are describing a system based on a wrist-worn inertial sensor to spot drinking motions with an accuracy of 94\%. An additional magnetic coupled sensor attached to the shoulder is used to determine the relative position of the wrist-worn sensor and thereby to recognize the type fluid container and the remaining fluid level with a accuracy of 75\% respectively 72\%. The spotting of motions is based on a feature similarity search using euclidean distance and uses 20 features generated out of the raw sensor data.\\
In \cite{7038937} Dong, B. et al. are also using an inertial sensor to \\
