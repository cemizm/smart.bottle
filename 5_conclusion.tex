\section{Conclusion}
For the estimation of water intake a machine learning method using a inertial sensor equipped bottle was proposed. On the basis of the collected training data, typical patterns of a drinking event was identified and a Hidden Markov Model classifier was trained to detect these patterns. In order to satisfy the requirements, methods with low computational complexity were used to estimate the volume of a drinking event. The two-stage process of volume estimation achieves an accuracy of 95 \% in event detection and an RMSE value of 13.18 in the estimation phase. Future work can focus on collecting more data by using different bottle types and multiple subjects to further generalize the proposed method.
